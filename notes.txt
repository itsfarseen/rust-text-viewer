How to generate font atlas
--------------------------

 A Store all the chars in Unicode?

   There are 150k chars in Unicode.
   At 20px, we get 400px per char approx.
   150,000 * 400 = 60,000,000
   Roughly 2000x2000px atlas.

   Won't work well for higher font sizes as we are already at the texture size limit.
   Could split into multiple textues.

 B For every document, get all the characters in the document
   and generate the atlas.

   Will have to regenerate the atlas for every text document.
   Size of the atlas will be smaller.

*C As we process the document, cache the glyph bitmap for every (glyph, font-size)

   Check if (char, font-size) is in cache.
   If yes, use that
   else call freetype to draw it and put it in cache


How to scroll
-------------

 A Generate the whole page at once as a texture

   Could hit the texture size limit very easily.

 B Generate the whole page at once, but split into multiple textures

   High memory usage.
   Simpler to implement.

 C Generate 3 pages (prev, current, next)

   When scroll down 0.5 page, (prev = current, current = next, next = render())
   Will cause more redraws than previous, but memory efficient.

*D Re-render on scroll
 	
	 Turns out once we have the font atlas, copying from the atlas on to the window is really fast.
